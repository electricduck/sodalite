    ðŸª¨ Long Release
</h3>

<p align="center">
    As of <strong>25-Jul-2023</strong>, this release is only available on <strong>Long (4)</strong> branches (<code>sodalite/long-4/&lt;arch&gt;/&lt;edition&gt;</code>).
</p>

<p align="center">
    You should opt to stick with the <a href="https://github.com/sodaliterocks/sodalite/releases/tag/v/6/6.0/current">latest release</a> on the Current branch and avoid sticking with an older version. However, if that release is causing problems (e.g. problematic drivers, outdated packages, update conflicts you are unwilling to resolve currently, etc.), <strong>4.x</strong> will continue to be updated until its end-of-life. At that point, it is vital you update to a more modern version.

        * `fedora` (default for Fedora Silverblue)
        * `localhost`
        * (empty)
* Added [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/) (free and non-free) RPM repositories
* Various other quality-of-life improvements

### ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changes
