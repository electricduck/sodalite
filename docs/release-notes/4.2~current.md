### âœ¨ What's New?

* Added more edge-cases for hostname migration
    * The hostname will be set as `sodalite-XXXXXX` (from the migration service &mdash; `sodalite-migrate.service`) if the current hostname is set to:
        * `fedora` (default for Fedora Silverblue)
        * `localhost`
        * (empty)
* Added [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/) (free and non-free) RPM repositories
* Various other quality-of-life improvements

### ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changes

_Nothing. Yay!_
